```
git add .
git commit -m "message here"
git push
```

first navigate from your shell into the github directory, then use git add followed by the file name or . to stage all files, -A is a flag that will also check deleted files so git commit

git commit will commit your changes that have been added the -m flag means message, so write what your commit was about in quotes after that

git push will push it to your remote
